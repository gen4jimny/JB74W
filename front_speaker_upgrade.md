# Trim removal

*First remove the two Philips screws below the door handle and one screw in the door release recess, indicated in the picture below.*

* Next, remove the trim directly above the door panel by pulling from the top leading edge to release the single white clip and then pull gently towards you and upwards to release the latches at the bottom connecting it to the door panel.

* The door panel is secured with ten clips, nine white and one cyan (the cyan one seems to be more robust and more likely to detach from the panel and remain in the door) positions indicated below.

* Starting from the bottom leading edge of the door below the speaker grill, pull the trim away from the door panel to release each clip in turn. Sharp tugs are more effective than gradual pressure.

* Work your way along the bottom then up each side releasing the clips. To release the central white and cyan clip, it may help to slide your arm up behind the panel from underneath.

* Once all clips have been released, gently unhook the top lip of the trim from the door panel.

* It's likely that some clips will have detached from the trim and still be located in the door, such as the cyan clip in the image below. Using pliers and a suitable flathead screwdriver, lever these out and replace them in the correct locations on the door trim, otherwise reinstalling the trim will be difficult.

* Apply one half of the thin grey foam to the rear of your new speaker, adjacent to the speaker cone. Then connect the supplied wiring harness to the speaker terminals.

* Connect the wiring harness to the plug in the door panel and screw the speaker to the mounting ring, using self tapping screws that came with your chosen speaker.

* Apply half of the thicker grey foam around the front edge of the speaker body, taking care not to let it adhere to the speaker cone itself. Pinch the foam around the raised lip and make sure the foam is angled away from the centre of the speaker, so that it doesn't fold over the cone when the door trim is reinstalled.

* Leave the door trim detached for now and repeat the installation on the other door. Once complete, test that both speakers work as expected.

* To replace the door trim, start at the top, hooking the top of the trim panel over the black rubberised strip at the top of the door. Check alignment by looking to see if the trim clips are in position to locate into the holes in the door panel. Starting from the top, work your way down, pushing on the trim to click the clips into place. Don't forget to push below the door release lever and handle to click the two central clips into place.

* Reinstall the three Philips screws in the door release recess (1) and below the door handle (2 & 3).

Enjoy your improved audio experience!
