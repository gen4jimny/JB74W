== Introduction ==

{{Gen4|}}
The Gen4 (2018-) Jimny comes with two front speakers installed. No rear speakers are fitted, although the wiring necessary to connect them to the headunit is already in place (confirmed for SZ5, tbc for SZ4). This guide details how to install rear speakers using official Suzuki parts.

== Parts ==

This guide assumes that the following parts are being used.

* 99197-77R10 - rear speaker bracket kit.
* 99000-79BJ0-R00 - rear speaker kit (2 x Pioneer TS-G1320FZS)

* Small flat head screwdriver
* 10mm Socket & driver/ratchet
* #2 Philips screwdriver 
* Electrical tape
* Ruler or tape measure
* Scissors
* Suitable tool to pry plastic trim


== Preparation ==

* Measure 65mm from the bullet connects on each speaker wiring harness and wrap a couple of turns of electrical tape at this point, this helps avoid any damage to the wiring once installed.

* Fit foam padding strips to the speaker brackets, 15mm from the top of each bracket. On the passenger side (UK) of the car, only a single padding strip is needed (shown below). On the driver side a strip should be fitted to both sides of the bracket, to prevent chafing against the car wiring loom.

* The speaker wiring connector is taped to the loom as indicated below, remove the tape prior to installing the speakers. The speakers need to be oriented with the wiring harness facing towards the front of the car on the passenger side (UK) as shown and towards the rear of the car on the drivers side (UK).

* Once both speakers have been installed, test them BEFORE replacing trim!
